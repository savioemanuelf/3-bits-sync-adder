# 3-bit Synchronous Adder 

This repository contains a collection of circuit files that together form a complete synchronous adder. It was created for a university assignment.

## Project files

1. **HA.circ**
   - *Description:* This file contains the half adder.

2. **FA.circ**
   - *Description:* This file contains the full adder.

3. **registrador-3b.circ**
   - *Description:* This file contains the 3-bits register circuit.

4. **segmentos.circ**
   - *Description:* This file contains all the circuits that converts bits to a 7-segment display.

5. **conversor-7-seg.circ**
   - *Description:* This file contains the conversion of the 3 bits resulting from the addition.

6. **somador-3b.circ**
   - *Description:* This file contains the 3-bit adder, built with 2 full adders and 1 half adder.

7. **somador-sinc-3b.circ**
   - *Description:* his file contains the complete 3-bit synchronous adder circuit, importing all the previous dependencies.

## Usage

This project was developed and tested using Logisim, a digital circuit designer and simulation tool. To view and simulate the circuits:

1. Download and install Logisim.
2. Open Logisim.
3. Import the `.circ` files.
4. Simulate the circuits to observe their behavior.

Feel free to explore the circuits.
